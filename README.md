# HDS-Analysis-Solution-
Succession Planning Risk Analysis using Python + Power BI
# Hogan Development Survey Analysis

This project explores risk factors in executive teams using HDS assessment data.  
I used **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** and **Power BI** for insights.

## 📊 Key Files
- `Hogan Development Survey.ipynb`: Python analysis notebook
- `Hogan Development Survey.pbix`: Interactive Power BI dashboard
- `Data Analysis Exercise -- Template`: Raw HDS scores

## 💡 Summary
- N-1 team shows high risk in **Diligent, Bold, and Skeptical** traits.
- N-2 team shows higher risk in **Leisurely** and **Cautious**.

## 💡 Summary of Findings

### 👥 N-1 Team (Direct Reports to the CEO)

* This group tends to score higher in **Diligent**, **Bold**, and **Skeptical** traits.
* That means:

  * They might **try to be perfect** and end up **micromanaging** others.
  * They could be **very confident**, sometimes even **overconfident** or **not open to feedback**.
  * Under stress, they may become **doubtful of others** and **very critical**.

💭 *What this means:*
They’re likely to take charge and move fast, but might come off as too pushy or hard to work with if not careful.


### 👥 N-2 Team (Reports to N-1 Team)

* This team scores higher in **Leisurely** and **Cautious** traits.
* That means:

  * They may seem cooperative but might **quietly resist direction or feedback**.
  * They tend to **avoid risks** and may **take longer to make decisions**.

💭 *What this means:*
They bring **stability and careful thinking**, but might slow things down or avoid difficult decisions.



### 🤝 How These Teams Compare and Can Work Together

| Area             | N-1 Team          | N-2 Team           |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Decision-Making  | Fast and bold     | Careful and slow   |
| Leadership Style | Direct and strong | Quiet and reserved |
| Risk Approach    | Take risks        | Avoid risks        |

✅ **They can work well together** if:

* N-1 leads with energy and vision.
* N-2 keeps things grounded with thoughtful feedback.

⚠️ **But tensions may happen** if:

* N-1 feels frustrated by delays.
* N-2 feels overwhelmed or unheard.

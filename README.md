# HDS-Analysis-Solution-
Succession Planning Risk Analysis using Python + Power BI
# Hogan Development Survey Analysis

This project explores risk factors in executive teams using HDS assessment data.  
I used **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** and **Power BI** for insights.

## 📊 Key Files
- `Hogan Development Survey.ipynb`: Python analysis notebook
- `Hogan Development Survey.pbix`: Interactive Power BI dashboard
- `Data Analysis Exercise -- Template`: Raw HDS scores

## 💡 Summary of Findings
- N-1 team shows high risk in **Diligent, Bold, and Skeptical** traits.
- N-2 team shows higher risk in **Leisurely** and **Cautious**.

## 📊 Summary of Findings

### 🔹 N-1 Team (Direct Reports to the CEO)

The N-1 team exhibits higher average scores in:

* **Diligent** – A tendency to become overly perfectionistic or micromanaging under stress.
* **Bold** – May display overconfidence, arrogance, or ignore feedback.
* **Skeptical** – Can become distrustful, overly critical, or defensive during pressure situations.

🔍 *Implication:*
These traits suggest strong execution focus and assertiveness but may hinder collaboration if not balanced.

### 🔹 N-2 Team (Next-Level Leaders)

The N-2 team shows relatively higher scores in:

* **Leisurely** – May be passively resistant to direction or feedback, while appearing cooperative.
* **Cautious** – Likely to avoid risk or delay decisions out of fear of failure.

🔍 *Implication:*
They are likely more risk-averse, which supports thoughtful execution but could lead to slow action or indecision.

### 🔄 Comparison & Team Dynamics

| Aspect         | N-1 Team                | N-2 Team           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Decision Speed | Fast & bold             | Slow & cautious    |
| Collaboration  | Controlling & assertive | Reserved & passive |
| Risk Profile   | Overconfident           | Risk-averse        |

✅ **How they can work well together:**

* N-1 can drive vision and speed.
* N-2 can ensure stability and reduce blind spots.

⚠️ **Potential tensions:**

* N-1 may see N-2 as resistant or indecisive.
* N-2 may view N-1 as controlling or dismissive.
